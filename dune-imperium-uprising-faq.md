(Entries new and revised since December 14, 2022 are marked with a *)

ERRATA Missionaria Protectiva — This card is part of the Bene Gesserit Faction. Cards from the fi rst English printing are missing this underneath its title. (If you have replaced the misprints, note that there should be only two copies of Missionaria Protectiva in your Imperium deck.)

Rise of Ix rulebook: page 4 — A tech tile with a "once per round" ability (indicated by the fl ip icon) can be used during one of your Agent or Reveal turns. The fi rst English printing mistakenly said this could be done only during an Agent turn. page 8 — This instruction for Setup of Solo & Two-Player Games is missing from the fi rst English printing:

Remove four of the original cards from the House Hagal deck: the two Hall of Oratory cards and the two Rally Troops cards. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Alliance — If you have an Alliance token and lose Infl uence with that Faction, you also lose the token in either of these cases:

- You were previously tied for Infl uence with another player; the player you were tied with now takes the Alliance token. (If you were tied with more than one other player, choose one to take it.)

- If you have fallen to 3 Infl uence or lower. (If no player has 4 Infl uence or higher to take the Alliance token, return it to the game board.)

Archduke Armand Ecaz — To use his "Coordination" ability, you must have at least two Agents on spaces with any of the three listed Agent icons. The Agents don't need to be on spaces with the same icon.

Assassination Mission — You must use some other means to trash this card for its 4 Solari; the card provides no way to trash itself.

Baron Vladimir Harkonnen — You choose the Factions for the "Masterstroke" ability after completing all setup, before the fi rst round begins. You may only reveal your choices and gain Infl uence one time during a game.

Beguiling Pheromones — When you use this to trash the other grafted card, you can't also get an eff ect on that card that requires trashing it as a cost. For example: when you use Beguiling Pheromones to trash a grafted Imperial Spy, you cannot also draw an Intrigue card using Imperial Spy (as trashing the card is a required cost for that eff ect).

You can use Beguiling Pheromones to trash a card that would otherwise be trashed anyway (for example: Foldspace, Seek Allies).

- Carryall — The base spice you harvest is 1 from Imperial Basin, 2 from Hagga Basin, and 3 from The Great Flat. (When playing Uprising, it is 2 from Habbanya Erg and 4 from Deep Desert.) See also Ghola.

Chairdog — Once you return the other grafted card to your hand, you must complete your Reveal turn. You cannot change to an Agent turn and play the card you returned.

## Chani — See Retreat.

## Charisma — See Intrigue Cards.

Chaumurky — This Tech tile is an Endgame tiebreaker between players with the same number of Victory Points. (The amount of spice, Solari, water, and garrisoned troops those players have is irrelevant; the player with Chaumurky wins.)

Confl ict — The rules for giving rewards in a Confl ict are the same for one, two, or three players. They are diff erent only for four players.

See also troops, "When you win a Confl ict."

- contract — it is mandatory to complete a contract when you fulfi ll its conditions. When you have multiple contracts for the same board space, they are all completed in one turn, by sending one Agent to that space. If a contract's condition is sending an Agent to a board space, the contract is another eff ect of your Agent turn. You may carry out the contract eff ect in any order with the eff ects of the board space and the Agent box of the card you played.

Corner the Market — Count the total number of The Spice Must Flow cards in your deck and your discard pile. Count each opponent's The Spice Must Flow cards separately; if any one of them has more than you (or the same number as you), you don't meet the second requirement of the Intrigue card.

Count Ilban Richese — The "Ruthless Negotiator" ability works only when paying Solari for the printed cost of a space on the game board (not, for example, when using one of your cards with an ability that costs Solari).

- Countess Ariana Thorvald — The "Spice Addict" ability is not optional. It affects only the spice you harvest when sending an Agent to a maker board space, not spice you receive by other means. When playing Uprising, it is possible to harvest no spice from Deep Desert and Hagga Basin (if there is no bonus spice there, and you choose to summon a sandworm rather than take base spice). In such a case, you did not "harvest spice" (even if you used another card that gives you spice), so the "Spice Addict" ability does not apply.

## See Also Maker Board Space.

## Demand Respect — See Intrigue Cards.

discard — When a player is directed to discard a card (for example: Reverend Mother Mohiam, Test of Humanity), this means a card from their hand, unless otherwise specified.

- Dispatch an Envoy — This card does not remove any icons from the affected card. It also does not add a copy of an icon that a card already has. For example: you graft Slig Farmer to Spice Hunter and play Dispatch an Envoy. One of Spice Hunter's two agent icons is Fremen, so Dispatch an Envoy adds only the other three icons. You gain 5 Solari for Slig Farmer. Double Cross — At least one opponent must have a troop in the Conflict for you to play this Intrigue card. (But you do not need to have any troops in your supply.)

dreadnoughts — The base game rules require you to have a "troop" in the conflict for you to have strength, count your swords, and play Combat intrigue cards. A deployed dreadnought allows the same, even if you have it in a conflict without any troops. However, a dreadnought in your garrison does none of these things, and does not add strength to the conflict.

- Endgame — In the extremely rare case that the endgame tiebreakers listed in the rulebook aren't enough to resolve a tie, the final tiebreaker is the player who most recently took a Reveal turn. Faction — See Tleilaxu track.

Foldspace — You can only acquire this card using the Foldspace icon (for example: the board space of the same name, Ilesa Ecaz).

- Gather Intelligence — See Spies.

Ghola — When grafted to Carryall, you get four times the base spice you harvest with your Agent.

When grafted to Kwisatz Haderach, you still send only one Agent on your turn (though you draw two cards).

## Guild Bankers — The Discount Applies To Each Copy Of The Spice Must Flow You Acquire During Your Turn.

- Guild Envoy — You must discard a card when you play this on an Agent turn.

Gun Thopter — An opponent with no garrisoned troops is unaffected by this card's Agent box.

## Helena Richese — See Manipulate.

Ilesa Ecaz — For her "One Step Ahead" ability, the "otherwise" means you still sent an Agent using the card you set aside, but that card did not have exactly one Agent icon. If you don't use the set aside card, you get nothing from the ability.

- Infiltrate — See Spies.

infiltration — When using a Rise of Ix card with an infiltration icon, you may send an Agent to a board space where there is already an enemy Agent. You do not have to do this; you may use the Agent icon normally, to send an Agent to an empty board space.

Imperial Spy — You must use this card to trash itself in order to draw an Intrigue card. (You don't draw one when it's trashed by other means.)

Intrigue cards — To play an Intrigue card, you must meet its conditions and pay its costs. For example: you must have a seat on the High Council to play Councilor's Dispensation, you must pay 2 Solari to play Bribery, and you must have reached at least the first genetic marker to play Disguised Bureaucrat.

You may play any Plot Intrigue card during one of your Agent turns or your Reveal turn. If the card does something that won't apply until your next Reveal turn (for example: Charisma, Recruitment Mission), keep it face up in front of you until then, then use and discard it.

In the rare case that you exhaust the Intrigue deck, shuffle the discarded Intrigue cards to form a new deck.

See also "When you win a Conflict," Reveal turn.

Liet Kynes — Cards from your Agent turns this round and your current Reveal turn count; Liet Kynes provides 2 persuasion for each.

- maker board space — Any of the board spaces where spice may be harvested: Hagga Basin and Imperial Basin, The Great Flat (in the original Dune: Imperium), and Deep Desert and Habbanya Erg (in Uprising).

- Maker hooks — You do not "spend" your Maker hooks to summon a sandworm.

- Manipulate — The ability on Helena Richese and the Intrigue card from Uprising work in the same way:

Your opponents cannot acquire the card you remove. You may use other means to acquire the card (for example: Bypass Protocol, Boundless Ambition), though the 1 persuasion discount will not apply. If you don't acquire the card by the end of your next Reveal turn, remove it from the game.

## * Optional Effects — Most Effects From A Board Space Or Card You Play Are Mandatory, Unless:

- a card says "you may" do something; • there's an arrow in the effect (if you don't want the effect, you may choose not to pay the cost—except when playing an Intrigue card, where paying a cost is required);

- you're trashing a card using the "black X" card icon (but note that it is not optional when a card tells you—without using an arrow—to trash itself).

## See Also Shield Wall.

paying a cost — When an arrow indicates a cost you may pay to receive an effect, you may only choose to do this once. For example: when you play Duncan Idaho, you may pay 1 water to recruit a troop and draw a card; you can't pay 2 water to recruit two troops and draw two cards.

Plans Within Plans — There are six spaces on each Influence track; you have 3 Influence on a track if you reach the space one above where you score a Victory Point.

## Poison Snooper — See Reveal Turn.

"Princess" Yuna Moritani — If you gain Solari more than once during your turn, her "Smuggling Operation" ability applies each time (for example: you recall your Freighter and take 5 Solari, and also play the Windfall Intrigue card; you would take 2 additional Solari).

When you gain Solari from Slig Farmer, you gain only 1 additional Solari from Yuna's "Smuggling Operation" ability.

## Rapid Mobilization — See Retreat.

Recruitment Mission — This entire card applies only to your Reveal turn this round. (It does not let you put cards you acquire during an Agent turn on top of your deck.) If you acquire more than one card during your Reveal turn, you may choose differently for each one whether to put it on top of your deck or in your discard pile as usual.

## See Also Intrigue Cards.

Refocus — If your discard pile is empty when you play this card, reshuffle your deck.

## See Also Reveal Turn.

## Retreat — When A Card Allows You To Retreat "Any Number" Of Troops, You May Choose Zero.

Reveal turn — If you draw a card during your Reveal turn (for example: Poison Snooper, Refocus), you must immediately reveal that card and use it this turn.

If you draw a card after your Reveal turn, you keep it until the next round, where you will draw five additional cards and thus have more cards than usual for the round. For example: you win the Trade Monopoly conflict, recall your Freighter from the top of the Shipping Track, and acquire the Spaceport Tech tile, drawing two cards. It's after your Reveal turn, so you keep those two cards. Next round, you draw five more and have seven cards for the round.

- Reverend Mother Jessica — You may use her "Reverend Mother" ability on the same turn you flip to this side of the Leader card. Reverend Mother Mohiam — Your opponents choose the cards they discard, beginning with the player to your left and proceeding clockwise.

## See Also Discard.

- Rivals — When a House Hagal card shows two different spaces to play an Agent, only look at the one that matches the current game conditions (for example: the Rival's Influence, or the Conflict card number). If that space is occupied, do not use the other option on that card. Instead, reveal a new card.

When playing Rise of Ix, if a Rival takes its influence for the second space of the Shipping Track, and there is a tie for the Faction in which it has the least Influence, the player with the First Player marker (or acting next after a Rival who has it) chooses between them.

When playing Uprising, if a Rival is first to gain a Swordmaster, the cost for other (human) players is reduced to 6 Solari.

## See Also Solo Play.

## Score Track — See Victory Points.

- Shaddam Corrino IV — The "Sardaukar Commander" gives you the option to acquire a set-aside Sardaukar contract in place of one of the generally available contracts. You do not begin the game with the Sardaukar contracts in your possession.

The "Emperor of the Known Universe" ability affects only the turn in which it is triggered, not the remainder of the round. In a six-player game, it will affect your activated Ally.

## * Shield Wall — Destroying The Shield Wall With The Shield Wall Icon Is Optional. Once Removed, The Shield Wall Is Gone For The Remainder Of The Game.

Shifting Allegiances — If you choose, you may lose and gain Influence with the same Faction (ultimately gaining one Influence with that Faction).

As with any cost, you must actually pay the cost (losing one Influence) in order to gain two Influence. You can't "lose" Influence with a Faction where you have none.

Solo Play — Rivals in Solo Play do earn Victory Points from a Faction's Influence track (both for reaching 2 Influence and for having an Alliance token). They do not receive the bonus for reaching 4 Influence.

When using Expert Troop Deployment, a Rival fighting for a Conflict I or II card won't deploy troops if it is already leading by 4 strength or more. (In the Rise of Ix expansion, dreadnoughts mean that you should count a Rival's strength to determine deployment, not just its troops.)

## See Also Conflict, Rivals.

Sort Through the Chaos — When you win this Conflict, you take the Mentat at the start of the next round.

## Spaceport — See Reveal Turn.

- Spies — To recall a Spy to Infiltrate or Gather Intelligence, you must still play a card on your Agent turn. You may recall two Spies in one turn if each is used for a different effect. For example: with Spies on Research Station's two observation posts, you can recall one to Infiltrate and one to Gather Intelligence, but not both to Gather Intelligence. The Spice Must Flow — You keep the Victory Point for acquiring this card even if you later trash it.

Staged Incident — When using this Intrigue card, move your Combat marker to lower your strength as you would with any other adjustment caused by a Combat intrigue card.

Tech tiles — If a Tech tile does not specify a time when you use it, then it must be used during one of your turns. For example: Spy Satellites has two different effects. The second specifies it is used at Endgame, The first (pay 3 spice and trash the Tech tile to score a Victory Point) does not specify a time to use it, so it must be used during one of your turns.

## Test Of Humanity — See Discard.

- tiebreaker — See Endgame.

Tleilaxu track — The Bene Tleilax are not a Faction. Effects that let you gain Influence with any Faction can't be used to advance on the Tleilaxu track.

## To The Victor… — See Intrigue Cards.

troops — When you recruit a troop, it must come from your supply. You can't recruit a Negotiator from the Ix board. When you send an Agent to a Combat space, you can't "re-recruit" troops in your garrison to get around the limit of deploying up to two troops from your garrison to the Conflict area.

When you send an Agent to a Combat space, any troop you recruit that turn, from any source, can be deployed to the Conflict area. (This includes, but is not limited to, troops from an Intrigue card, Tech tile, or the Shipping track.)

Victory Points — You can score more than 12 Victory Points, even though the Score track only goes to 12 (enough for most games).

"When you win a Conflict" — Combat Intrigue cards that do something "when you win a conflict" can't be played when you tie for victory with another player.

If you receive an Intrigue card as a reward for winning a Conflict, and that card can be played "When you win a Conflict," you may choose to play it immediately.
